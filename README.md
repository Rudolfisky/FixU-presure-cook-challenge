# FixU-pressure-cook-challenge

# Concept
We want create a product that can help people use less energy when they shower. In order to help them we want to make a smart shower that will automatically lower the water temperature after showering for a set amount of time (like 5min) till the water being used is no longer heated.

This system will either motivate people to shower less, but also use less energy by using non heated water.
