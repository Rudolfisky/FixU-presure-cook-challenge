# Concept
![brainstorm](./Media/mindmap%20brainstorm.jpg)
We want create a product that can help people use less energy when they shower. In order to help them we want to make a smart shower that will automatically lower the water temperature after showering for a set amount of time (like 5min) till the water being used is no longer heated.

This system will either motivate people to shower less, but also use less energy by using non heated water.

# Moscow demo requirements
The requirements set for our final demo.
## Must
- Measure/mock water temperature.
- Timer to control water temperature.
- Water temperature visualization.
- Working water system (flowing water).
## Should
- Display water use on display.
- Temperature knob.
- water flow control
## Could
- Heating element to control water temperature.
- Water budgeting system.
- Water flow sensor.
- different showering modes.
## Wont
- Infra-red camera

# Minimal Lovable Product
The minimal loveable product is centered around the shower timer that gradually gets colder either motivating the user to stop showering or using less energy for the duration of the shower. The MLP would therefor mean showing a user that that the shower gets colder over a set amount of time(via led).
